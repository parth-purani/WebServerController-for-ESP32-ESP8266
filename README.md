# 🕸️ WebServerController for ESP32/ESP8266

This code defines the `WebServerController` class, designed to seamlessly manage a web server on ESP32 or ESP8266 modules. It bridges hardware interaction, like LED control, with network capabilities to offer a responsive web interface for remote hardware management.

## 🗂 Key Components of the Code

### 📄 Header File (.h)

- **Class Declaration**: `WebServerController` integrates methods to initiate and manage the web server, handle WiFi connections, and interact with Arduino via serial commands.
- **Private Members**: Stores crucial details like WiFi credentials, LED pin number, and an instance of `AsyncWebServer` for efficient handling of asynchronous HTTP requests.

### 🛠 Source File (.cpp)

- **Constructor**: Configures WiFi SSID, password, and the LED pin.
- **begin() Method**:
  - Initiates serial communication for debugging.
  - Connects to WiFi, displaying the IP address upon success.
  - Establishes web server routes including:
    - Root (`/`): Serves a basic HTML page with options to turn the LED on or off.
    - `/on` and `/off`: Endpoints to toggle the LED state, issuing commands to Arduino via serial.

- **sendCommandToArduino() Method**: Communicates with Arduino over serial, updating the internal LED state based on received commands.

- **HTTP Request Handlers**: Employs lambda functions for streamlined handling of GET requests to toggle the LED via the web interface.

## 🌐 Web Server Routing and Interaction

- **Setup**: The `_server.on()` method sets specific endpoints that react when accessed:
  - Root (`/`): Returns an HTML interface.
  - `/on` and `/off`: Manage LED states and signal Arduino to act.

- **LED Control**: Accessing `/on` or `/off` triggers `sendCommandToArduino`, sending appropriate serial commands to Arduino for LED management.

## 🚀 Functionality and Use Case

This framework enables remote control of Arduino-connected hardware via a web interface hosted on an ESP module, ideal for IoT applications like home automation or remote data monitoring.

- **Asynchronous Server Advantage**: The use of `ESPAsyncWebServer` ensures effective multiple connection handling, crucial for system responsiveness and scalability.

- **System Architecture**: Serves as a conduit between user interfaces and physical devices, enhancing system flexibility and ease of maintenance.
